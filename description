ðŸ•’ Enhanced Alarm Clock â€“ Desktop Reminder App
This is a Python-based alarm clock built using the tkinter GUI library. It provides an intuitive and interactive interface to set, stop, and snooze alarms with several useful features:

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Set Custom Alarms: Choose the exact hour, minute, and second for the alarm.

Live Clock Display: Real-time digital clock updates every second.

Sound Alerts: Optional alarm sound using winsound (requires sound.wav in the same directory).

Snooze Functionality: Quickly delay the alarm by 5 minutes with a single click.

Repeat Daily Option: Enable daily repetition of the alarm at the same time.

User-Friendly Controls: Start, stop, and snooze buttons along with toggle switches for sound and repeat.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works:
Select the desired time using dropdowns.

Click "Set Alarm" to activate it.

When the time matches, the app displays a "WAKE UP" message and plays an alert.

You can stop the alarm or snooze it for 5 more minutes.
